# Dokor
Idea schematic: Responsive app for keeping track of Doppelkopf statistics

# Features
This project is just a collection of ideas. I will use this project basically 
to study on various software techniques.

## Client Framework
I can use this app to study on Angular based apps. Research the possibilities 
of cross-platform support.
* [Native Script](https://www.nativescript.org/) seems the way to go.
    * Possible to use Angular, Vue and others
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
    * Native code can be dropped-in
    * On the first look, it is not easily possible to reuse code from normal 
      browser app.
* [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/) worth checking out, but seems stuck at 
  Version 0.0.1.
    * [Todo App](https://github.com/ankitsinghania94/vue-native-todo-app) 
      Sample

## Server Framework
There should be a database in the back.
* [Redis](https://redis.io/) NoSQL
* [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/de): for free?
* [SQLite]() Somehow standard. Need to question if this is available on client 
  side also.

## AI
One could think of counting cards with the camera. This could be used to study 
on AI based computer vision.
